Fido
====

Fido protein inference tool, adapted for cross-platform build.

Fido is a free software tool used in the area of computational proteomics. It calculates posterior probabilities for protein identifications based on database searches of tandem mass spectra. The website for Fido is here:

The original Fido C++ source code (from http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/fido/fido.tgz) could not be built under Windows. We are therefore making an adapted version available that should build under Linux, Mac and Windows (using CMake).
